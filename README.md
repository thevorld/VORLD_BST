## Database Setup

### MongoDB

- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
- Set the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file.

### SQL Database (PostgreSQL)

- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Set the `SQL_URI` in your `.env` file.

**Database Configuration**

You can enable or disable database connections using environment variables:

- `USE_MONGO_DB`: Set to `"true"` to enable MongoDB connection, `"false"` to disable.
- `USE_SQL_DB`: Set to `"true"` to enable SQL database connection, `"false"` to disable.

**Readiness Check**

The readiness check now verifies the connectivity of both MongoDB and SQL databases. Ensure your databases are running and accessible for the server to be considered "ready."
